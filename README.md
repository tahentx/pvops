## pvops
Library of tools for solar asset management, monitoring, and O&amp;M.

PV Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is multidisciplinary. On any given day, managers may face issues with data quality, monitoring diagnostics across a variety of interfaces, and other technical challenges. On the commercial side, there is negotiating with service providers, and warranty adjudication with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). In a competitive marketplace, where margin compression seems to be impacting everyone, the wise manager leverages technology to optimize his or her fleet.

PVOps is a tool to help achieve that end. Just as O&M draws on expertise from a variety of fields, PVOps is an amalgamation of tools from several other Python libraries. My vision is of a manager with a command line, arriving at data-driven decisions in every context he may find himself. The code cannot solve the problem. Rather, PVOps provides heuristics for analysis, aiding judgment, intuition and experience. 

In June 2019, I am introducing the first three functions.
